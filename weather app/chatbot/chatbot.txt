HTML/CSS:
Box Model: The box model in CSS describes the layout of elements on a web page, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin.
Doctype Declaration: It defines the version of HTML in use and helps browsers render the page correctly.
display Property: block makes an element a block box, inline makes it an inline box, and inline-block combines characteristics of both.
avaScript:
Hoisting: In JavaScript, variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation.
== vs. ===: == checks for equality with type coercion, while === checks for strict equality without type coercion.
Closures: Closures are functions that have access to variables from their outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
React:
JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React that resembles XML or HTML and gets transpiled to JavaScript.
Component Lifecycle: React components go through mounting, updating, and unmounting phases, each with specific lifecycle methods.
setState: setState is used to update the state of a React component, triggering a re-render.
Responsive Design:
Making a Website Responsive: Use media queries, flexible grids/layouts, and responsive images.
Media Queries: CSS media queries allow styles to be applied based on the characteristics of the device.
Adaptive vs. Responsive Design: Responsive design adjusts to different screen sizes, while adaptive design tailors the layout for specific devices.
Web Performance:
Performance Improvement Techniques: Minimize HTTP requests, optimize images, use asynchronous loading, and leverage browser caching.
Lazy Loading: Loading images only when they are about to be viewed.
Minimizing HTTP Requests: Reduce the number of elements requiring separate server requests.
Version Control:
Git: Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development.
Rebase vs. Merge: Rebase integrates changes from one branch into another, while merge combines changes from different branches.
Merge Conflict Resolution: Manually edit the conflicting parts in the code and commit the resolved changes.
Web Accessibility:
Importance of Accessibility: Ensures that websites are usable by people of all abilities and disabilities.
ARIA Roles: Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) roles provide additional information to assistive technologies.
Common Accessibility Issues: Lack of alt text for images, insufficient color contrast, and keyboard navigation issues.
Build Tools:
Webpack: Webpack is a module bundler that bundles JavaScript, CSS, and other assets for web development.
Babel vs. ESLint: Babel transpiles modern JavaScript to an older version, while ESLint checks code for stylistic and programming errors.
Code Splitting: Break down a large codebase into smaller, more manageable parts that can be loaded on demand.
Testing:
Unit Testing in JavaScript: Testing individual units or components of a program in isolation.
Manual vs. Automated Testing: Manual testing is done by a human, while automated testing uses scripts or tools to test.
Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework commonly used with React for unit and snapshot testing.
General Problem Solving:
Coding Problem: Solving FizzBuzz or reversing a string demonstrates basic coding proficiency.
Debugging Approach: Systematically identify and fix bugs by using debugging tools and reviewing the code.
Challenging Problem: Describe the problem, the steps taken to solve it, and the outcome, emphasizing problem-solving skills and perseverance.
